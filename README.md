# school homework
This is the homework that I've done, roughly categorized. 

Except for the basic things about HTML and CSS we have worked on:
1. Flexbox
2. Grid *(with some flexbox)*

We got an [assingment](https://github.com/Hampus83/insurance-exam) wich is grade-based and I  worked on it with [Hampus](https://github.com/Hampus83). (Great job!)

3. Interactivenes
