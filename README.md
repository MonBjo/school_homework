# School Homework
_This is the homework that I've done, roughly categorized. _

### HTML and CSS
Althrough I have played around with CSS and HTML before -so I had a lot knowledge already- I have also learned a lot. My way of doing *was* quite oldschool. <br>
It's like I've upgraded my sword to a lightsaber. 

### Javascript with ES6+
I'm having a small project to create a Discord-bot and I struggled greatly with it, so I figured I should have it as a parallel project with the course and [apply what I learn to the bot](https://github.com/MonBjo/discord_bot). 

## HTML and CSS
