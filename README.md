# School Homework
_This is the homework that I've done, roughly categorized._

_Some courses that we've done are more practical and didn't involve any programming so they obiously don't show here. We have also learned about UX/UI (mostly done in Figma), an introduction to programming and computer logics, and how to work Agile._

_I [study](https://www.folkuniversitetet.se/vara-skolor/yh-utbildningar/alla-yh-utbildningar/it-data/frontendutvecklare/) to become a frontend dev._
